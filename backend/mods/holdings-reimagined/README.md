# Holdings Reimagined

This mod is a complete overhaul of the vanilla holding system, with a focus on balance and gameplay enhancements.

## Features

- **Holding Types**: Change the type of your holdings, including duchies, realms, and more.
- **Capital Management**: Move your capital holdings to any province, with cooldowns for duchies and realms.
- **Building Management**: Upgrade and add buildings to your holdings, with a customizable GUI.
- **Building Slots**: Purchase building slots to expand your holdings.
- **Game Rule Adjustments**: Adjust game rules to feudalize or replace vassal counties

AI will also add building slots when they have enough gold.

You have 3 additional buttons in the holding.

- **Add Slots**: Add slots to the max (soft limit) and build all the vanilla buildings level 1 at once
- **Upgrade Buildings**: Upgrade all the existing buildings by level 1
- **Clear Holding**: Clear the holding (simply remove all the existing vanilla buildings)

There are also domain-wide decisions for the above 1-3 functions.(useful, if you have that many domains)

There is also no religious restriction on special buildings.

It also enables cities for all government types.

It has a scroll area for building slots in the county view so you can see all your slots without cluttering the county window.

This mod also removes the need for holdings with multiple baronies to have a Castle, City and Temple Holding. This allows you to build only Castles or only Cities/Temples on your counties.
