As the smoke rises from burning buildings and the screams of the vanquished fill the air, my men jubilantly gather the spoils of our conquest.\n\nThe streets run red with blood, and the cries of the defeated echo through the ravaged halls. [sacked_county_owner.GetTitledFirstName] will surely be devastated by this news, their power and prestige diminished in the wake of our ruthless assault.\n\nReports from my captains speak of overflowing coffers, priceless relics, and a stream of captives being led away in chains. The name of [raider.GetTitledFirstName] will be whispered in fear throughout the land, a stark reminder of the price of defiance.\n\nThis victory shall be etched into the annals of history, a cornerstone in the legacy of my ever-expanding domain."

The landscape itself seems transformed; old shrines repurposed, new places of worship erected, and the very air thick with the scent of unfamiliar incense.\n\nThe people of [county.GetNameNoTier], though some still cling to old ways in secret, outwardly embrace their new spiritual path. Time will tell if this conversion will bring the unity and stability you seek, or if the embers of the old faith will continue to smolder beneath the surface."
