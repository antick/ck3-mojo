# Age of Invasion

A mod with ability to become a conqueror and do invasions and conquests.

- Gives you a special Conqueror casus belli type
- Added Game rules for: Troop Inheritance, Increased GQ Chances, and Player can become conqueror.
- Added the option to refuse to become the Great Conqueror upon recieving the event.
- Made Nomadic Horse Lords get actual horse archers and light infantry instead of armored knights.
- Add more casus belli types like border disputes.

## Introduction
This mod seeks to make the game and map more dynamic, with great, ambitious people, rising from nothingness into great emperors and kings.

### How does the mod work?
For someone to be a great conqueror and get everything that entails it, he needs to be a very, very good military commander, he needs to be ambitious and he has to be at least a duke. If that kind of person exists, there is about 0.75% chance for him to become one.

### What does a great conqueror get?
He gets a load of troops, bannermen that are loyal to him, he gets a ton of gold and prestige.

### Do the conquerors actually conquer?
Yes! So a new system has been made to force great conquerors into a war to expand their territory very often, so there will be no great conquerors with 50k troops sitting around in a realm size 5 domain.
