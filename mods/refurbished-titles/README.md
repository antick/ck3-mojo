# Refurbished Titles

Updated titles of the rulers.

## Features

1. Seljuk turks and Oghuz dukes will be now called Emirs.
2. If the Seljuk Turks and Oghuz emperors grant kingdom titles to their vassals, those vassals won't be called sultans anymore. Instead, they will be known as Atabegs. However, if they become independent, they can be called Sultan.
3. Custom titles for the councillors.

## Todo

1. Add more title flavors based on the government type, culture and religions.
