# Grand Council

This mod offers you extra slots on your council where courtiers and vassals can serve as your advisors.

Each advisor can handle tasks (more diverse tasks are in the works!).

The number of slots you have depends on your rank in the game.

This mod comes with three modes, which you can adjust in the settings:

Realistic - Provides small bonuses.
Boost - Multiplies advisors' skills - you can set the multiplier in the settings.
Cheat - Similar to Boost, but some tasks might grant bonuses regardless of the advisor's education.

## TODO

- Enabling the AI to use the realistic version of the mod, allowing it to keep up with your gameplay!
